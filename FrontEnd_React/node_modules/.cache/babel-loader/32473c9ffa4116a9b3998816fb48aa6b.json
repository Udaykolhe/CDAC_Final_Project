A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of: </p>\n//  <ul>\n//   <li>State : It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.</li>\n//   <li>Behavior : It is represented by methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.</li>\n//   <li>Identity : It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.</li>\n//   <li>Method: A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return result to the caller. A method can perform some specific task without returning anything. Methods allow us to reuse the code without retyping the code. In Java, every method must be part of some class which is different from languages like C, C++ and Python. \n// Methods are time savers and help us to reuse the code without retyping the code.</li>\n//  </ul>\n// <div className='player' controls>\n//   <ReactPlayer url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pv3FpH2Wso&t=53s'/>\n// </div>\n// <h2>Pillar 1: Abstraction</h2>\n// <p>Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user.The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.\n// Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details. The properties and behaviours of an object differentiate it from other objects of similar type\n// and also help in classifying/grouping the objects.\n// Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know about how on pressing the accelerator the speed is \n// actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of accelerator, brakes etc in the car. This is what abstraction is. \n// In java, abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes.
